            <div>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    Because of religious persecution, Early Christians were not 
                    able to establish official public places of worship until after the year 
                    300. In 312 Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan which put an end 
                    to Christian persecution in Rome and legalized the faith. With this legalization 
                    of Christianity, the growing Early Christian population was in need of official places 
                    of worship. To aid the faith, Constantine constructed these necessary places of worship 
                    in the form of basilicas across his empire.

                The Structure
            </h3>
            <div>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    The Christian basilica consisted of a rectangular space 
                    divided into a central hall (later called the nave), with side 
                    aisles separated by a colonnade. At the eastern end of the nave was 
                    the raised platform of the sanctuary with a canopied alta. Behind the
                     altar was a bishop's chair (cathedra), with seats for the priests 
                     and deacons on either side. The sanctuary was separated from the nave 
                     by a triumphal arch. Because the sanctuary with altar and cathedra were 
                     piritually most important in the hierarchy of the Christian basilica, the apse 
                     and the triumphal arch were typically decorated with paintings or mosaics depicting 
                     bible stories and church teaching. These buildings also often had an atrium either off to the side or
                     in front of the structure.

                </p>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    The altar was made up of stone and placed upon a raised 
                    platform with stairs. Within or below the altar were placed the 
                    remains of a saint if the basilica wasn’t already built upon a saint’s tomb.
                     The entire design of the basilica looked to emphasize the importance of the 
                     altar as the central place of the Mass. The art and architecture worked together 
                     to lead the eye down the central aisle of the nave toward the altar at the center 
                     of the sanctuary. These basilicas are also early examples of when Chrisitan architecture
                      started taking the shape of crosses when viewing them from the top down.

                Relation to the Church

            <div>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    These new basilicas gave a growing Christian community places 
                    to worship in the Roman Empire. These basilicas suited the Christians’ 
                    needs and allowed a place for the faithful to worship away from the unfaithful. 

                </p>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    The architectural contrast of a pagan temple to a christian 
                    basilica is symbolic of the christian faith in general. Typically
                    temples were designed to be outwardly appealing while Christian basilicas
                     were designed to be appealing within just as Christianity focuses on the 
                     inner value of a human being as a child of God. The mosaics within the basilicas
                      helped the church community to understand church teachings through their depiction
                       of those teachings along with biblical stories and figures. 

                </p>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    The most significant basilica built was Old St. Peter’s Basilica. 
                    Some of the other significant Roman basilicas of the early Church were 
                    St. John Lateran (324), St. Paul Outside-the-Walls (386), and St. Mary Major
                     (432). Along with St. Peter's, these churches became known as the "patriarchal 
                     basilicas of Rome." The two most unaltered basilicas from the Early Christian era,
                      however, are Santa Sabina (422) in Rome and Sant'Apollinare (520) in Ravenna.

                Modern Application
            </h3>
            <div>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    One major concept that we can take away from the introduction 
                    of basilicas into the world is the symbolism of the focus on inner beauty as 
                    opposed to outer beauty. As Catholics, our faith focuses on the concept of inner 
                    spirituality just as Early Christians did back then. However, sometimes as people 
                    of faith we can focus too much on pointing fingers at others who we think are acting
                     in unholy or undignified ways. Even if we think that we are correct in some way, it 
                     is important that as people of faith that we examine ourselves in order to make sure 
                     that we are not hypocritical and to make sure that we are acting as examples of Christ
                      ourselves. We can put more of our focus on looking inward and seek to make ourselves 
                      better examples of Catholics. 

                </p>
                <p class="subpage-text-box">
                    Another element of the basilicas that we can take into our modern world 
                    is the use of biblical stories to convey church teaching. In basilicas this 
                    was done in mosaic form, but today we can use other forms of communication to 
                    spread the word of God. Our modern world gives us many forms of communication 
                    like social media or text messages. Whether we choose to use these forms of 
                    communication or not, we can always look to draw examples, either from the bible
                     or real life, to exemplify church teaching and continue the mission that God gave
                      us to evangelize the world.
